# MusicPartOntology (MPO)

An ontology designed to formalize symbolic representations of music by focusing on the structural and sequential aspects of tracks, such as chords, chord progressions, and music parts. MPO transforms raw symbolic music data into a machine-readable format, representing it as a knowledge graph. This repository contains the tools and examples for utilizing MPO in Music Information Retrieval (MIR), demonstrating its integration with other ontologies and enabling advanced music analysis tasks.
